    <p>I slightly modified the first prompt to show how the Scoot brand could be applied in multiple marketing contexts. Using concise, direct messages that connect with the core elements of Scoot, these advertisements encourage viewers to re-evaluate how they use transportation services for work and leisure. User acquisition and engagement might also be increased by welcoming new riders with a sticker for their vehicle, laptop, etc. This approach demonstrates how Scoot could compete with other leaders in the transportation / sharing economy space (Uber, Getaround, et al.) who are utilizing traditional advertising vehicles.</p>

    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Create a template for an in-app how-to-scoot guide</h2>
    <p>The second project shows a how-to-scoot experience in the Scoot mobile application. Before sketching out my ideas, I endeavored to identify critical areas that needed attention. I drew from from several sources including the current application, Scoot blog, some friends who scoot frequently and lastly, myself, a veteran rider. After concluding my research, I outlined the user flow and polished it up on Sketch. I used web technologies (HTML, CSS, JQuery) to share the experience with the team at Scoot. The prototype looks at the user journey through the how-to-scoot module. I didn’t allow an opt-out or exit affordance, but if I were to implement this project I would be sure to align with the team on the objective of this feature. Because it’s an open-ended prompt, I made assumptions and focused on how a user would move through the information and absorb the material. I added illustrations, videos, demos, and helpful links (e.g. FAQ links) to enhance the experience.</p>

    <p>This project is a prototype and there are a few things that I would investigate and refine if I were working on this full-time. Although the prototype is responsive, but I would like to polish it further and optimize the size of text, test on multiple devices, and make sure that load times and animations were fast and smooth. Second, I would want to make or find videos that were optimized for the mobile experience. The videos that I placed in this prototype are just placeholders. Lastly, if I were a designer at Scoot, I would work closely with all stakeholders in the project (especially engineers) to ensure that we’re taking the right direction to add value to the product, rather than just “making it pretty”.</p>
